# Greenspace and Crime in Seattle

### Goal
----
This project will look at the rates of crime within Seattle's neighborhoods as well as the distribution of greenspaces (and their quality) to answer the question: What impact does access to nature have on crime rates? 

### Documentation
----
This project focuses on three databases to understand the distribution of crime and greenspace. 

- [**SPD Crime Data 2008 - Present**](https://data.seattle.gov/Public-Safety/SPD-Crime-Data-2008-Present/tazs-3rd5) which tracks the crime in Seattle 
- [**Seattle Public Spaces**](https://data-seattlecitygis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/SeattleCityGIS::publicspaceseattle-entrypts/explore?location=47.611555%2C-122.355840%2C11.46) which is an overview of parks in Seattle which are open to the public. 
- [**Seattle **]()

### Data Values of Interest 
----
Because of the scoping of my project, I do not intend to use all of the data values from each of these datasets. In order to give the best overview of my project, I will only be describing values the are directly used to my project. The full description of values in the dataset are  linked in the headers above each list. 

[**Seattle Public Spaces**](https://data-seattlecitygis.opendata.arcgis.com/maps/SeattleCityGIS::public-and-open-spaces-in-seattle-1/about)
- **public access:** the degree of access/ the time frames for which people can enter the space
- **greenspace:** whether or not there is a lawn
- **status:** is the park open or under construction
- **tier:** the level of the park in ranking, 1 is the highest tier, 6 is the lowest tier


[**SPD Crime Data 2008 - Present**](https://data.seattle.gov/Public-Safety/SPD-Crime-Data-2008-Present/tazs-3rd5)
- **Offense:** type of crime (e.g. shoftlifting)
- **MCPP:** police district (e.g. Colombia City)
- **Crime Parent Offense:** type (e.g. Property)

## Issues or Considerations 
When we think about data, it is critical to think about the third variable problem, in which we cannot attribute
