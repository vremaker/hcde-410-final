    "## Abstract \n",
    "\n",
    "Nature has a huge impact on overall human well being. This study sought to understand the relationship between access to natural spaces, such as parks, and the amount of crime in a given area. This study focused on two conditions: high crime and high parks. High crime meant that there was a higher percentage of crime than parks, while high parks meant there was a higher percentage of parks than there was of crime. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first part of the study investigated the question: Do areas with more greenspace have less crime? On average, the high crime condition had about half the greenspace of the high park condition. On average, the high park condition also had significantly less crime than the high crime condition. This indicates that having more greenspace might have an impact on the amount of crime. \n",
    "\n",
    "The second part of this study investigated the question: Does the the quality of parks in the area affect the amount of crime? On average, the high crime condition had a rating that was .6 lower than the high parks condition. This indicates that when there are more parks in an area, they are usually of higher quality. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although there was a relationship shown in this study, it is also critical to consider other variables which might have an impact on this relationship, namely: population in a neighborhood, size of the neighborhood, socioeconomic status within a neighborhood, and the ratio of stores, housing and natural space in a neighborhood.\n",

    "## Introduction & Background\n",
    "\n",
    "People are highly impacted by the envrionment in which they live. We, as humans, are inexplicably drawn to nature; which can have major effects on our well being. Having access to nature both wild and domesticated has a major impact on our mental health. For example, studies have shown that joggers who exercise in nature feel more restored and have less anxiety,than those who exerise at the gym (Louv, 35). Unfortunately, having access to safe nature is not always achievable. By looking at the accessibility of parks, as well as the quality of those parks, it is possible to gain a better understanding of their impact within the greater Seattle community. \n",
    "\n",
    "This study seeks to work along a similar framework to the broken window thoery which uses the number of broken windows to guague the amount of crime - more broken windows incidates higher rates of crime (Koglmeier). But, instead of the number of broken windows, we will be using the number of parks, as well as the quality of those parks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Across all of the literature that I reviewed, a key factor in the effectiveness of these parks and natural spaces - a key peice to making these public spaces effective is the need for a human centered approach with community engagement during the erection of these institutions (Koglmeier,Green Space and Crime, Ross). It is the human centered involvment in the development of these programs and spaces that makes the difference in these harm reduction programs. These spaces are not a means to an end in an of it self, but a proxy for community engagement (Ross). This poses a difficult question within my research in which the ways in which the databases I choose do not really include data about community invovlement within the development of these areas. Similarly, in the literature I reviewed, having greenspace does not automatically reduce crime; instead, these parks need to be well maintained and must not have hidden spots where crime could occur (Green Space and Crime). Luckily, in the Greenspace database, there is a tier ranking of the parks from 1 - 6 in which 1 is the highest tier and 6 is the lowest tier. This ranking scale could probably be used to mirror the quality of the park and more deeply understand park quality as it relates to crime rates.\n"

    "## Research Questions & Hypotheses \n",
    "There are two aspects of the relationship between parks and crime that I am interested in: the number of parks in a neigborhood and the quality of those parks. This focus informs my two research questions. \n",
    "\n",
    "**RQ1:** Do areas with more greenspace have less crime?\n",
    "\n",
    "**H1:** I beleive that there will be less crime in areas with more greenspace. \n",

    "## Methods\n",
    "Listed below are the steps that I took during my data analysis. To look at the code, take a look at 'Calculations.ipynb'\n",
    "\n",
    "**Section 1 - Calling The APIs & Sorting Data** \n",
    "\n",
    "0. Import all needed libraries, and sets up api endpoints and limits\n",
    "1. Query the Seattle Neighborhood Database and create a dictionary 'hood_counts' to track the data that I want for each of the neighborhoods. This is primarily concerned with: location of the neighorhood, number of parks, park rating, the average park rating in the neighborhood, and the number of crimes.  \n",
    "2. Query the Seattle Public Spaces Database and check the location of each public space against the neigbhorhoods using geodata. Qualifying parks will be public, open, and have either greenspace or forest areas. Then, the data about the greenspace will be added to the 'hood_counts' dictionary at the appropriate spot.\n",
    "3. Query the Seattle Crime Database and checks the location of each crime incient against the neighborhoods using geodata. Qualifying crime will be done within the last 5 years (2017 - 2022). Then, the data about the crimes will be added to the 'hood_counts' dictionary at the appropriate spot. \n",
    "4. calculates the average park rating for each neighborhood. \n",
    "5. Because the total number of crimes is going to be far higher than the number of parks, it was important to creates a dictionary of the hood_percentages which take the total number of crimes and parks for each neighborhood and divides them by the total number of crime and parks. This sets the baseline to understand which the distribution of crime rates and parks across the neighborhoods.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**RQ1: Do areas with more greenspace have less crime?**\n",
    "1. Compare the percentage of of parks in a given neighborhood to the percentage of crime within a given neighborhood. This helps get an overview of the breakdown of the greenspace and crime. \n",
    "2. Compare the percentage of of parks in a given neighborhood to the percentage of crime within a given neighborhood. This step focuses solely on the neighborhoods in which the percentage of crime is higher than the percentage of parks. This helps get a more specific look at the nuanced similarities and differences against \n",
    "3. Compare the percentage of of parks in a given neighborhood to the percentage of crime within a given neighborhood. This step focuses solely on the neighborhoods in which the percentage of parks is higher than the percentage of crime. \n",
    "4. Compares the average percentage of parks and crimes across the conditions of a higher percentage of crime and a higher percentage of parks. This helps to display a more concise version of the differences in percentage of crime and parks in both conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**RQ2: Does the the quality of the parks available in the area affect the amount of crime?**  \n",
    "1. Show the average park rating across the neighborhoods where there is a higher percentage of parks than crime. This helps understand the similarities and differences against the two conditions. \n",
    "2. Show the average park rating across the neighborhoods where there is a higher percentage of crime than parks. This helps understand the similarities and differences against the two conditions. \n",
    "3. Compare the average park rating across all the neighborhoods in which the percentage of parks was higher than the percentage of crime, and compares it to the average park rating across all the neighborhoods in wich the percentage of crime is higher than the percentage of crime. This use of averages creates a more vibrant picture of the quality of parks across the conditions of higher percentage of crime and higher percentage of parks. \n",

    "Because there are far more crime than parks, this comparison was broken down to look at the percentage of overall parks and crime within a specific neighborhood. For each crime or park percentage, it is the total number of crimes or parks in the neighborhood divded by the total number of parks or crime in all of Seattle. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](charts/all_hoods_compare.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As shown in 'Neighborhood Breakdown: Percentage of Overall Crime and Parks' chart, we have a mix of neighborhoods in which the percentage of crime is higher than the percentage of parks and vice versa. This means that there might potentially be an impact of parks on reducing crime. \n",
    "\n",
    "The next two charts make the same comparison of percentages of crime and parks, but groups them together by whether there was a higher percentage of parks or a higher percentage of crime. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this chart, we look at the neighborhoods where there are more parks. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](charts/high_crime.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chart, most neighborhoods have over 3% of the parks in Seattle and 8 of these neighborhoods had over 5% of the parks. The exception to this is Seward park, which has 2.7% of the parks, but again, this could be due to the size of the area. We also see that most neighborhoods in this bracket have between 3% and 6% of the crime in Seattle. \n",

    "In this chart, most neighborhoods have under 3% of the parks in Seattle. There are two exception of note. First, there is Capitol Hill, which has about 6% of the parks, and Queen Anne which has about 4% of parks. We also see that most neighborhoods have between 3% and 7% of the crime in Seattle. \n",
    "\n",
    "There seems to be a slight difference here for the average range of crime when the number of parks is concerned. To look into this more deeply, we compared the average percentage of parks and crime across the conditions of having a higher percentage of parks or having a higher percentage of crime.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](charts/average_percent_crime_parks.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This chart shows a pretty big disparity between the two conditions. In the condition in which there is a higher amount of crime, the average percentage of crimes is 6.1% which is about double the average percentage of parks 3%. But, in the condition where there are more parks, the average number of parks is far higher at 6.6%, and the average amount of crime much lower at  around .5%. \n",

    "To begin this section, let's talk a little bit about what the park ratings mean within the parks database. This rating system is on a scale from 1 -6 with a 1 being the best possible park, and 6 being the worst park. \n",

    "In the areas with more parks, there is also a better rating for the park, and more diversity within the park rating averages. The best average rating in this range is 2.3 and the worst average rating is 4. \n",

    "## Disucssion\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis seems to suggest an inverse correlational relationship between the number and quality of parks and crime rates. In this case, areas with more, higher quality parks see less crime. \n",
    "\n",
    "**RQ1 asked Do areas with more greenspace have less crime?** We found that on average, areas with a higher percentage of parks had drastically less crime when compared to areas with higher percentages of crime that had an smaller assortment of parks. \n",
    "\n",
    "**RQ2 asked Does the the quality of parks in the area affect the amount of crime?** We concluded that on average, areas with a higher percentage of crime had parks of lower quality when compared to areas with a higher percentage of parks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Both of my hypotheses were confirmed, and there does seem to be a relationship between the amount of crime and the quality and accessibility of nature in the city. But, this does not seek to prove causation. There are several potential factors that could influence these results namely:\n",
    "- **Population within a neighborhood:** There are a lot of industrial areas within Seattle which might not have that many people living in it, which could be a reason for fewer, lower quality green spaces.\n",
    "- **Size of the neighborhood:** Not every neighborhood in Seattle is the same size. The smaller neighborhoods might have less crime and fewer parks simply because there is less space for them. \n",
    "- **Socioeconomic status within a neighborhood:** Those in lower socioeconomic classes might not be afforded the \"nicer\" parks due to strucutral injustice within our governing bodies and the ways in which cities sometimes distribute funds based on the overall income of those living in the neighborhoods. There could also be higher crime rates becaues there are people making less, and they would not have the time to visit the green spaces. We also tend to see more policing in areas of lower socioeconomic status, which of course leads to higher rates of crime being reported, but it does not necesarily mean that there is not a similar amount of crime going on in the higher socioeconomic status neighborhoods in which there is less police patroling.\n",
    "- **Ratio of stores, housing, and natural spaces in a neighborhood:** One of the most noticable outliers for crime and green space was downtown. Which might be an indicator that areas that have a higher focus on retail have less of a need for green space because people can go home to their neighborhoods, which might have more greenspace, when they are done with their retail adventures. Or, it could also indicate that these places of business present more opportunities for crime, such as theft, which would be harder to do in a more residential area. \n",
    "\n",
    "It was really fascinating to look at the ways in which available natural spaces varies within Seattle, and this sets a great foundation which could potentially be the backbone for more research such as taking into account the factors listed above in additional research. Or, to potentially set the baseline for an ethnographic study which talks to people in these neighborhoods to learn more about how residents relationships to nature vary in the neighborhoods with a higher percentage of crime than parks and those with a higher percentage of parks than crime.

    "## Conclusion \n",
    "\n",
    "Having access to natural greenspace can be very benefical to human health and well being. But, not everyone has the same level of access to natural spaces due to the ways in which society has been developed. This research study sought to answer two questions: (1) Do areas with more greenspace have less crime? (2) Do areas with more greenspace have less crime? \n",
    "\n",
    "For research question 1, it was hypothesized there will be less crime in areas with more greenspace. This hypothesis was confirmed when they study found that on average, areas with a higher percentage of parks had drastically less crime when compared to areas with higher percentages of crime that had an smaller assortment of parks.\n",
    "\n",
    "For research question 2, it was hypothesized that having higher quality parks will be an indicator of less crime. This hypothesis ws confirmed when the study found that on average, areas with a higher percentage of crime had parks of lower quality when compared to areas with a higher percentage of parks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, these finding do have some limitations. There are a lot of other variables that might play into the reason that there is less crime in areas with more parks and greenspace. The majors factors that might be at play in this relationship are population in a neighborhood, size of the neighborhood, socioeconomic status within a neighborhood, and the ratio of stores, housing and natural space in a neighborhood. Further studies should consider the impact of these factors. This may also serve as a call to action to add set up areas in which having more, higher quality parks added could potentially be beneficial."
