    "I plan to use three databases from the seattle open data api. The following datasets will be the focus of my project: \n",
    "- [**SPD Crime Data 2008 - Present**](https://data.seattle.gov/Public-Safety/SPD-Crime-Data-2008-Present/tazs-3rd5) which tracks the crime in Seattle. This is to discovery what the crime rates are like, and what times of crime happen in which neighborhoods. Is there any correlation to the type of art and type of crime? Or amount of art/cutlure and amount of crime? I will be focusing on data from after 2017, to focus on the last 5 years of crime in the Seattle Area\n",

    "## Background\n",
    "This study uses greenspace such as parks and gardens as a proxy for understanding the environmental enrichment factors in a given neighborhood. This study seeks to work along a similar framework to the broken window thoery which uses the number of broken windows to guague the amount of crime - more broken windows incidates higher rates of crime (Koglmeier). In the literature I reviewed, having greenspace does not automatically reduce crime; instead, these parks need to be well maintained and must not have hidden spots where crime could occur (Green Space and Crime). In the Greenspace database, there is a tier ranking of the parks from 1 - 6 in which 1 is the highest tier and 6 is the lowest tier. This ranking scale could probably be used to mirror the quality of the park and more deeply understand park quality as it relates to crime rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Across all of the literature that I reviewed, a key factor in the effectiveness of greenspace is making these public spaces effective is the need for a human centered approach with community engagement during the erection of these institutions (Koglmeier,Green Space and Crime, Ross). It is the human centered involvment in the arts programs that makes the connection and difference in these harm reduction programs. These spaces are not  a means to an end in an of it self, but a proxy for community engagement (Ross). This poses a difficult question within my research in which the ways in which the databases I choose do not really include data about community invovlement within these spaces. \n",

    "## Research Questions & Hypotheses \n",
    "**RQ1:** Do areas with more greenspace have less crime?\n",
    "\n",
    "**H1:** I beleive that there will be less crime in areas with more greenspace. \n",
    "\n",
    "**RQ2:** Does the the quality of the parks available in the area affect the amount of crime in a given area? \n",
    "\n",
    "**H2:** I believe that having higher quality parks will be an indicator of lower crime. \n",
    "\n",
    "**RQ3:** Is there any relationship between the top 3 types of crime in a given neighborhood in comparison to the amount (and quality) of greenspace? \n",
    "\n",
    "**H3:** I believe the areas with higher quality parks will have crimes of less severity.     \n",
    "\n",
    "## Methods\n",
    "**All Data** \n",
    "0. Import all needed libraries, and sets up api endpoints and limits\n",
    "1. Create a dictionary to track the data that I want for each of the neighborhoods that are divided by the geometry for \n",
